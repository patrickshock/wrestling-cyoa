This is my wrestling choose your own adventure story.
You will need ruby. or for windows you need to look up ruby for windows
**_THIS IS NOT THE FINAL BUILD._**
but after the final build there will still be updates


## TO DO:
* Finish all of the WWE Storylines from beginning to the end.
* Work on TNA, I will do this a bit when I am still making the WWE Storylines
but after I do WWE then TNA is my main project.
* And right after TNA Then I do the indies.
* Add the feature to switch companies or switch from Big Leagues to The Indies, either by getting released or quitting. (Maybe more ways too, Who knows)
